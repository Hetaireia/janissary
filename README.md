## Why JANISSARY

Most DAST tools are either expensive enterprise platforms or raw scripts that produce unusable noise. JANISSARY is different in three specific ways:

**Differential detection eliminates false positives by design.** Every finding is gated by a baseline comparison. No finding is ever emitted from a single response alone.

**WAF-aware pacing keeps you under the radar.** JANISSARY detects Cloudflare, Akamai, Sucuri, Imperva, AWS WAF, F5, Barracuda, ModSecurity, Wordfence, and Fastly, then backs off on blocks and recovers on clean streaks.

**Multi-protocol coverage.** HTTP, XML-RPC, GraphQL, and WebSocket, combined into a single agent run.

![JANISSARY demo](docs/demo.gif)

One real SQL injection, scanned with `janissary scan`:

```text
$ janissary scan -u "http://localhost:5001/sqli?q=test" -p q

[*] Scanning http://localhost:5001/sqli?q=test
[*] Parameters: q
[*] Baseline samples: 10

[*] Probing for WAF...
    No WAF signatures observed
  [q] baseline is static - timing gates disabled
  [q] sql_single_quote -> CRITICAL: db_error | SQLITE error signature matched
  [q] sql_union_null  -> HIGH: status_change | Baseline 200 -> Payload 500
  ...

============================================================
SCAN SUMMARY
============================================================
  Target:          http://localhost:5001/sqli?q=test
  Parameters:      q
  Method:          GET
  Total requests:  29
  Findings:        11 in 2 groups

  Baselines:
    q: samples=10 mean=2.0484s std=0.0098s stable_body=True

  Findings:
    F-001  CRITICAL sqli:sql_injection  (param=q)
           - [sql_single_quote] db_error: SQLITE error signature matched
           - [sql_single_quote] status_change: Baseline 200 -> Payload 500
           - [sql_single_quote] length_anomaly: Response 3.6x baseline
           - [sql_or_1eq1]      length_anomaly: Response 3.8x baseline
           - [sql_union_null]   status_change: Baseline 200 -> Payload 500
           - [sql_union_null]   length_anomaly: Response 10.1x baseline
           - [sql_sleep_mysql]  status_change: Baseline 200 -> Payload 500
           - [sql_sleep_mysql]  length_anomaly: Response 3.3x baseline
           - [sql_sleep_pg]     status_change: Baseline 200 -> Payload 500
           - [sql_sleep_pg]     length_anomaly: Response 5.8x baseline

    F-002  LOW      sqli:reflection  (param=q)
           - [sql_single_quote] payload_reflected: Payload reflected (raw)

  Findings by severity:
    CRITICAL   1
    HIGH       4
    MEDIUM     5
    LOW        1
```

Eleven signals, **one bug**. Every piece of evidence for `F-001` points
at the same SQL injection, so JANISSARY groups them. `F-002` is a
different root cause (reflection) and stays separate. One finding to
triage, with the receipts attached.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Damn-Infidel/janissary.git
cd janissary
pip install -e .
```

---

## Quickstart

Accept the Terms of Use (required once before any network command):

```bash
janissary terms accept
```

Scan a single endpoint:

```bash
janissary scan -u "https://target.example/sqli?q=test" -p q
```

Scan a Git repository for leaked credentials:

```bash
janissary creds ./my-repo --scan-git
```

Fingerprint a target:

```bash
janissary fingerprint https://target.example
```

Probe for admin panels:

```bash
janissary admin https://target.example
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scan` | HTTP scanning: SQLi, XSS, SSRF, traversal, cmdi |
| `creds` | Credential discovery in tree or Git history |
| `fingerprint` | CMS and technology identification |
| `graphql` | GraphQL detection and field enumeration |
| `ws` | WebSocket recon |
| `admin` | Admin panel discovery, 18 platforms |
| `agent` | Orchestrates recon, persists findings |
| `terms` | Show, check, or accept Terms of Use |
| `attack sqli-union` | UNION extractor (gated) |
| `attack nuclei` | Nuclei runner (gated) |

Run `janissary --help` for full flags.

---

## Attack modules

The `attack` subcommands are opt-in. They require `--attack-confirm` in addition to the Terms-of-Use gate. Neither alone is enough.

- **`attack sqli-union`** - extracts DBMS version, current database, database list, and table list from a vulnerable parameter. Hard limits: 32 columns, 100 rows, 64KB. Aborts on instability.
- **`attack nuclei`** - shells out to the Nuclei binary, streams JSONL, parses findings. Requires an explicit template list; refuses to run Nuclei's default set.

---

## Agent

The `agent` command ties the recon modules together: fingerprint, detect WAF, consult the platform knowledge base, run applicable modules, persist findings.

```bash
janissary agent https://target.example --attack-confirm --store findings.json
```

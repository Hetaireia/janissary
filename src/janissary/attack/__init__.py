"""Active exploitation primitives.

This package is architecturally separate from `detection` on purpose.
Detection identifies; attack extracts. Keeping them in separate
packages makes the distinction explicit in the code layout, which
supports the good-faith-research framing in LEGAL.md.

Every module in this package is destructive-adjacent. Every CLI
entry point into it must require an explicit --attack-confirm flag
in addition to the Terms-of-Use gate.
